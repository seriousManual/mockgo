Mockgo is a in-memory mocking engine for mongodb.
In [contrast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-mock-server) [to](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mock-mongo-db) [existing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-mock) [solutions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-mock) mockgo does not try to imitate the mongodb interface by implementing its methods.
Instead it uses the same approach [Mockgoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mockgoose) uses and spins up an actual mongodb instance which holds the data in memory.
That way the full feature set of mongodb can be used.

Works on all platforms which is due to the awesome [mongodb-prebuilt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-prebuilt) package.

After spinning up the mongodb instance a connection to that instance is automatically created and returned.

## Installation
````
npm install mockgo
````

## Usage
Require mockgo, then retrieve a connection to the in-memory instance of mongodb by calling `getConnection`.
An optional database name can be specified.

````javascript
var mockgo = require('mockgo')

mockgo.getConnection((error, connection) => {
  //`connection` is the connection to the mongodb instance
})
````

You can retrieve connections to as many databases as you wish.
They are internally cached.

## Example
````javascript
var mockgo = require('mockgo')

mockgo.getConnection('testDatabase', (error, connection) => {
    var collection = connection.collection('testDataCollection')

    collection.find({}).toArray((error, result) => {
        console.log(result); //result: []

        collection.insertOne({test: 'data'}, (error, result) => {
            collection.find({test: 'data'}).toArray((error, result) => {
                console.log(result); //result: [ { _id: 56f52afef6d8838417df1688, test: 'data' } ]

                mockgo.shutDown(() => console.log('shutdown complete'))
            })
        })
    })
})
````

## Methods and Properties

### mockgo.getConnection([databaseName], callback)
Returns a connection to a in-memory instance on mongodb.
If no `databaseName` is specified a dummy name will be used.
If a connection to the same database is requested multiple times a cached version of the same connection instance is returned.

The connection instance is a instance from the official native [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) driver.

If you wish to use another version of the mongodb package you can easily override it by setting the `mongodb` property *before* requiring a connection:

````javascript
var mockgo = require('mockgo')
var mockgo.mongodb = require('mongodb') //version xyz

mockgo.getConnection((error, result) => {
    // ...
})
````

### mockgo.shutDown(callback)
Closes all existing mongodb connections and shuts down the mongodb instance.

### mockgo.mongodb
Exposes the version of the official native mongodb driver, gives the possibility to override it.

## Testing with Mocha

This is an example for a simple test with `mockgo` in mocha.

````javascript
var expect = require('chai').expect
var mockgo = require('mockgo')

var Loader = require('../lib/Loader')

describe('loaderTest', () => {
    var result, error

    before(done => {
        mockgo.getConnection((error, connection) => {
            expect(error).to.be.null
            loader = new Loader(connection)

            loader.loadSomething((_error, _result) => {
                error = _error
                result = _result
                done()
            })
        })
    })
    after(done => mockgo.shutdown(done))

    it('should not return a error', () => expect(error).to.be.null)
    it('should load something', () => expect(result).to.deep.equal({awesome: 'data'})
})
